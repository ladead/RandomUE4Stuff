# RandomUE4Stuff

currently most of the stuff is in ThirdPersonBP commented on and the NPCBP is just basic blueprint with trigger, mesh,
and a materal billboard with a float  curve used to fade the materal out. oh and the audio stuff is in there but im still messing with it and the sound files used are just random songs
